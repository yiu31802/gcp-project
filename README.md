# About this project
This is a GCP project in Java aiming for implementing a AppEngine
that deals with a large dataset originated from Twitter.

This work has nothing to do with my primary job, but rather for
personal interest in GCP and in Twitter data.

Throughout the development of the project, I encapsulate pieces of
technology concepts in `src/test`. Also some related links that I
found useful and relevant are stored in commit message.

# Planned GCP components to use

- BigQuery
- Datastore
- Dataflow
- AppEngine Standard and Flexible
- (?) Dataproc or ML Engine
